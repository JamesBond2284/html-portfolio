 <h2>Top 3 movies of all time</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Turning Red</h3>
 <p>This Banger from disney is one of the best in town.</p> 
    <p>You can feel the drama, the romance, the music(so awesome!) and it's not sensitive content based so your kids can watch.</p>
 <h3>Devil May Cry</h3>
 <p>This is one of the best action movies ever made. The fight scenes are so well choreographed and the story is very interesting.</p>
 <h3>Fast and Furious</h3>
 <p>Wanna know about drifting, speeding, exploring? Join Vin on Fast and Furious(by watcing it, Haha!)</p>
